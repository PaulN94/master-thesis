# My Master Thesis Experiment

## Introduction

In this experiment, we aim to investigate the effects of caffeine on cognitive performance. We will recruit participants and randomly assign them to either a caffeine or placebo group. Then, we will measure their cognitive performance using a series of tests.

## Participants

We will recruit 50 participants from the local community. Inclusion criteria are:

- Age between 18 and 30 years
- No history of neurological or psychiatric disorders
- No current use of medication that affects cognitive function

## Procedure

Participants will be randomly assigned to either the caffeine or placebo group. They will be asked to consume their assigned substance 30 minutes before the cognitive tests. The cognitive tests will include:

| Test | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Stroop Test | Measures selective attention and cognitive flexibility |
| Digit Span Test | Measures working memory capacity |
| Trail Making Test | Measures visual attention and task switching |

## Results

We will analyze the data using a mixed-design ANOVA with group (caffeine vs. placebo) as the between-subjects factor and test type (Stroop, Digit Span, Trail Making) as the within-subjects factor.

## Conclusion

We expect to find that caffeine improves cognitive performance on all three tests. This has implications for the use of caffeine as a cognitive enhancer in academic and professional settings.
